Module 3 Solution - HTML, CSS, and JS for Web Developers (Coursera)

This is the solution for Module 3 of the Coursera course. It contains one HTML file (`index.html`) that uses Bootstrap 3 to create a responsive web page.

The page includes:

* A navbar with the brand name "Food, LLC"
* A hamburger menu for mobile view with links to sections
* Three menu item sections: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi
* Responsive layout that adjusts for desktop, tablet, and mobile views

To view the page, open `index.html` in your browser or host the files on GitHub Pages.
